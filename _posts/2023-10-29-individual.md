## Struggles:
- Duck DNS super unreliable
- When redeploying on AWS very weird -> certificate 
- Error with getting the class selected in character customization 
- Constructing a post request with fetch 
- Neat tip: If you get rid of const, var or let before a decalring a var it becomes global
- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
- Fix was in backend where I needed to enable CORS in soulsCharacter.py
- Needed to set mode to CORS in frontend
- Nifty trick: user localStorage to store data so that it can be accessed later
