## Role on Passion Project
- DevOps
- Frontend



## Favorite Commits
### Commit History
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/commitHistory1.png">
> These commits are for interaction between the frontend and the backend
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/commit1.png">

> Updating player object throughout the game

## What I want to improve 
- Ability to load progress after closing the tab
- Error with upgrade screen
- Change the cmd logic

## Struggles:
- Duck DNS super unreliable
- When redeploying on AWS very weird -> certificate 
- Error with getting the class selected in character customization 
- Constructing a post request with fetch 
- No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
- Fix was in backend where I needed to enable CORS in soulsCharacter.py
- Needed to set mode to CORS in frontend
- Nifty trick: user localStorage to store data so that it can be accessed later

## Future Plans For Individual
- Theme that changes every time you load on to individual website
- Add a scrum board to individual to make things easier
> Currently Use Trello & github issues, want to make the plans a scrum board:

## College Board Quiz Notes
<!-- HTML -->
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/1.png">
> I didn't know what citizen science was, but now I know that it is when citizens help out with research. The correct answer would be C, because it enables a larger number of people to participate, regardless of their location, so there could be more data. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/2.png">
> Unsolvable problems can't be solved with algorithms, however, algorithms can help with the debugging process. For example, if I want to iteratively print an output to see where an output is incorrect.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/3.png">
> There are multiple other pathways to get to S, however there is only one pathway to get to S in option B. Therefore, it is not redundant. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/4.png">
> Lossy transformation is when the encoded string can be restored to its original version. Since you can find the original version from a byte encoded message by replacing all the % with TH and # with IS, it is a lossless transformation.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/5.png">
> The option that I selected can be shortened because there are multiple instances of the same pair of letters(e.g ME). However, in option B, the correct answer, there are no repeated instances of the same two characters.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/7.png">
> The option I selected was incorrect because the Move_Forward procedure was inside the CAN_MOVE(right) check, so the robot would never move forward 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/8.png">
> The correct answer is A because if A and B are different values then the AND statement will return false. If both C and D are false, then the OR statement will return false. At the final operator neither of the arguments would be true so the OR operator would return false.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/9.png">
> The algorithm actually runs in reasonable time because each time, n is being squared. It isn't doing anything else other than squaring the number of items, so it runs in reasonable time.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/10.png">
> Only two would create an overflow error. If the program is only alloted 4 bits that means it covers values between 0 and 2^4-1. 7+10 is greater than that values so it would return an overflow error.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/11.png">
> The option I chose was incorrect because it would evaluate to false when P and Q are different in value. The NAND gate should only be false when both inputs are true. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/12.png">
> The option I chose is incorrect because it is not possible to create an algorithm to solve the undecidable problem for every possible program and input. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/13.png">
> I got it incorrect because the recipient's private key is required to decrypt the message in public cryptography. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/14.png">
> I got the question wrong because linear search can work without a sorted list. Since it just iterates through and checks if the target and current value are equal to each other. 
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/15.png">
> I misunderstood what the parameters are for the Substring procedure. The answer is B because the substring goes from H to two characters later which would be A. For Puppy it would start at character three then go three characters later
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/16.png">
> I was incorrect because redundancy could act as a backup to ensure video files are not lost. The answer would be B because the full-quality original versions of videos would be lost if lossy compression is used.
<img src="/LabNotebook/images/Quiz/17.png">
> The answer would be to have a larger number of perspectives reflected in encyclopedia content because user's can edit articles and provide input across the web.
