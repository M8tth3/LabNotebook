    "## Python Code is Much Friendlier than HTML \n",
    "> After modifying some jupyter notebook files and working with python more, it is very clear that python doesn't want to make me claw my eyes out just by looking at the code. On a more informational note, there were a few things I noticed that there were some improvements that could be made. The most obvious was the repetition during the \"check if correct\" phase of the code. Lots of repetition in code, especially in large blocks can make the code messy and less efficient to work with.
